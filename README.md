# CCTV Surveillance System

This is a simple CCTV surveillance system created using Python. The system allows you to start and stop camera recording by typing 'Yes' or 'No'. Recorded videos are stored in a folder named `footage`, where you can access previous recordings.

## Features

- **Start and Stop Recording**: Begin recording by typing 'Yes' and stop by typing 'No'.
- **Storage**: Recorded videos are stored in the `footage` folder for easy access.
- **Access Previous Footages**: All recorded footage is saved and can be reviewed later.
